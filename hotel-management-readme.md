# Hotel Management System - Sequence Diagram Lab

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive sequence diagram lab focusing on composition, generalization, and service controllers for a hotel management system. The project was developed using Visual Paradigm to create class and sequence diagrams that model the operations of Relaxing Stay Hotels, a fictional hotel chain in Ontario.

## Objectives
- Create class and sequence diagrams with generalized and specialized objects
- Develop class and sequence diagrams for objects in a composition relationship
- Utilize Service controllers to demonstrate interfaces with subsystems

## Case Study: Relaxing Stay Hotels
The project revolves around Relaxing Stay Hotels, which owns multiple hotels throughout Ontario. The system is designed to manage employees, rooms, and various hotel operations.

## Project Components

### 1. Class Diagram
A comprehensive class diagram was created to represent the hotel management system's structure, including:
- Hotels and their relationships with managers
- Employee types (managers, cleaning staff, front desk staff)
- Room management
- Certification requirements for managers

### 2. Sequence Diagrams
Four detailed sequence diagrams were developed to illustrate key scenarios:
1. Generate Employee List
2. Hire Manager
3. Create a Service Ticket
4. Set up new hotel

### 3. Operations
Each class in the diagram was updated with relevant operations based on the interactions shown in the sequence diagrams.

## Tools Used
- Visual Paradigm: For creating and editing all UML diagrams (class diagrams and sequence diagrams)

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Composition and Inheritance/Generalization in class relationships
- Encapsulation and use of Service Controllers in sequence diagrams
- Proper assignment of operations to classes based on sequence diagram interactions

## Files Included
- Visual Paradigm (.vpp) source file
- Word document containing exported diagrams and explanations
- This README file

## How to View the Project
1. Install Visual Paradigm (if not already installed)
2. Open the .vpp file in Visual Paradigm to view and interact with the diagrams
3. Refer to the Word document for static views of the diagrams and additional explanations

## Future Enhancements
This project serves as a foundation for a hotel management system. Potential future enhancements could include:
- Implementing the designed system in a programming language
- Adding more complex scenarios and operations
- Integrating with a database for persistent data storage
